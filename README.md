Hi, I'm [Oliva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-bellis-06365572/)! I am a mid-level software developer and you can follow my continuing journey and projects here.

My primary programming language experience is JavaScript, and I have enough HTML and CSS to do solid front-end work. Most of my work is dealing with front-end interactive development based around web map packages such as [Mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), [Maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js), and [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers). But I have dabbled in a lot of middleware tech using AWS to help deliver content to the front-end portion. I also have skills in SQL and various database systems from Oracle to DynamoDB. Recent additions to my development experience have come from incorporating GQL into my code writing as well.

I have a varied background in archaeology and geographic information systems (GIS). Software development spurred out of these two fields, even going as far as receiving my master's in archaeology at Lund University where I specialized in digital tools and technologies in the field (GIS, 3D Modeling, Photogrammetry, UAV/Drones, etc...). My thesis was an overview of the state of long-term preservation of 3D data in archaeology through the implementation of reuse, visualization, and distribution of said data. Although I am fully back to being a software dev, I do hope to get back to archaeology again one day.
