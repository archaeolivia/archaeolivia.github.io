Hi, I'm Jason! I am still early in my career as a software developer but you can follow my continuing journey and projects here.

My main skills include JavaScript, but have enough HTML and CSS to do some basic front-end dev. Most of my work is front end interation technology based around web maps such as Mapbox-Gl and OpenLayers. But I have dabled in a lot of middleware tech using AWS to help deliver content to the front end portion. I also have skills in SQL and various database systems from Oracle to DynamoDB.

I have a varied background in archaeology and geographic information systems (GIS). Software devopment spurred out of these too fields. Recently finishing up my masters in archaeology at Lund University where I specialized in digital tools and technologies in the field (GIS, 3D Modeling, Photogrammetry, UAV/Drones, etc...). My thesis is on long term preservation of 3D data in archaeology through implementation of reuse, visualization, and distribution of said data.

Currently seeking work so feel free to reach out!
